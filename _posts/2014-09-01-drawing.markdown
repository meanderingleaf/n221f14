Drawing using Pixi.js
-------------------------

Pixi.js is a *javascript library* that is used to draw to something called the *canvas* (we'll be working with the canvas even more later). It lets us create (and animate) visual elements with relative ease. To get running with it we need to understand a few things about color and how the computer displays graphics.


Positioning
--------------------------

When working with positioning in computer code, you most often will be working in units of **pixels**. The *upper left corner* of the screen will be pixel [0,0].

*X increases* as you go further right on the screen.

*y increases* as you go further down the screen.

So, if you have a screen that is 800x600 pixels, a point in the middle of it would be [400,300].

Color
-----------------------------

Color, in pixi, is set using *hexadecimal*. We're not going to go into how to convert the colors manually. Just know that if you want a specific color you will need to look it up, either using photoshop or a tool online.

*Some color examples*

	* **Red:** 0xFF0000
	* **Green:** 0x00FF00
	* **Blue:** 0x0000FF
	* **White:** 0xFFFFFF
	* **Black:** 0x000000

Drawing

AKA 'this is where the magic lives'. Let's get through the drawing setup first. **Assuming you have pixi.js and pixi.d.ts in your src folder**
